# GUI for ATS

**Graphical User Interface for Microsoft Azure Trusted Signing**

## üìå Overview
**GUI for ATS** is a user-friendly graphical interface that simplifies the use of **Microsoft Azure Trusted Signing**. It streamlines the process of signing files, making it easier for developers and businesses to integrate secure code signing into their workflow.

## üîê Security Advantage
The main advantage of this application is that you do not need to create the environment variables  
**`AZURE_CLIENT_ID`**, **`AZURE_TENANT_ID`**, and **`AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`**.  
This data is securely stored in encrypted form after you enter it and is only used in plaintext during the signing process.
